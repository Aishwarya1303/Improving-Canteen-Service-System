# Improving-Canteen-Service-System
This was my first major B.Tech project under the Design Thinking and Innovation course. Inspired by post-COVID issues like canteen crowding and long queues, our team developed a smart canteen system. It lets students pre-book meals through a simple mobile/web interface to reduce waiting time and improve the overall dining experience.
# Project Title: Canteen Pre-Order Web App

A smart food-ordering platform designed to reduce queues and streamline service in college canteens.
